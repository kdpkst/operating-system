# Basic Concepts before OS Kernel Implementation
**CPU architecture**:  
**compiler**:  
**emulator**:  
**nasm**:  
**qemu**: stands for Quick Emulator, is an open-source machine emulator that can run operating systems and software designed for one architecture (e.g., x86) on a system with a different architecture (e.g., ARM, PowerPC, MIPS). It is valuable for developers and testers, allowing them to develop, test, and debug software on various architectures without the need for physical hardware.
